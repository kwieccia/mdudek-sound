achieve the intended effect. During long-lasting projects, an extra outer ear can be an invaluable

        <p>Sound design is about building and creating sounds that will tell the message that is in the picture or make it stronger. No matter if it is a game, a movie or an advertisement, the sound makes the image alive.
</p>
        <p>Sound design for me is what the colours for the painter are. A mismatched sound can completely change the perception of the image. When I work with sound design, the very first thing I care about is the feeling that the sounds make. During the work I focus on matching perfectly the sound to the image, so that the viewer truly believes that both the sound  and the image are the unity.

        <p>Mix is the use of technology to create art. It's like scattered puzzles that have to be put together one by one having in the back of my head the image of what you asked for. Mix is finding the right balance between the different elements of the musical composition, so that the message is catchy and correct.</p>
        <p>While mixing your material, I will reveal the true character of the composition without changing its sound. I will only make it fuller.</p>

        <p>Each project: a game, a film or an advertisement has a climate created by the creator and a mood which has to be seen by the viewer. The right composition is crutial.</p>
        <p>When I work with the composition, I keep repeating myself the question: "does this sound cause these specific emotions that are in the blueprint?". The technique and experience which I gained in earlier years, make me able to build a world of your image that will provoke the planned reaction to the viewer.
