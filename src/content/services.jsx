        <p>Sound design is about building and creating sounds that will make it stronger or create a message that is in the picture. No matter if it is a game, a movie or advertisement, the sound makes the image live.</p>
        <p>Sound design for me is that what are the colors for the painter. Mismatched can completely change the perception of the image. When I working with sound design, first think about the feelings that the created sounds make. During the work I focus on perfectly matching the sound adaptation to the situation on the image, so that the viewer to believe that the sound had a chance to really exist.</p>

        <p>Mix is the use of technology to create art. It`s like scattered puzzles that have to be put together and have a picture of what you want to get in my head. Mix is finding the right balance between the different elements of the musical composition, so that the message is correct.</p>
        <p>Mixing your material I will bring out the character of the composition without changing its sound. I will only make it fuller.</p>

        <p>Each project: game, film or advertisement has a climate created by the creator and a mood which has to be seen by the viewer. The right composition has the key meaning.</p>
        <p>When I work with the composition, I keep repeating myself the question: "does this sound specifically do those emotions that are in the blueprint?". This technique and experience, which I gained in earlier years, make that I am able to build a world for your image that will do the planned reactions to the viewer.</p>
